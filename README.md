# FSND-Neighborhood-Map-Project: My favorite ballparks
In this project, we were asked build a single page application displaying our favorite neighborhood or area.  I expanded that area a bit to display my favorite baseball parks I enjoy to visit.  I utilized the Knockout framework and Ajax to retrieve the Wiki info for each park. 

## Directions:
- Download the Zip file and extract it locally
- Open "index.html" with a browser
